## Key Analyses  

### 1 First Interaction Channel  
We examined where new accounts first engaged with the business.  
**Key takeaway:** Most accounts come from **direct channels (193 accounts)**, followed by **organic (42)** and **Facebook (41)**.  

### 2 Churned Customers (50%+ Drop in Orders)  
We flagged accounts with a 50%+ decline in monthly average orders between H1 and H2 2016.  

**Major losses include:**  
- **PepsiCo, Apple, VF, WellCare Health Plans, General Electric, DuPont** â€“ all showing **100% drop** in orders.  
- **Community Health Systems, Whole Foods Market, Time Warner, Disney, BorgWarner** â€“ severe drops between **70% â€“ 85%**.  

These accounts represent high-value clients and need immediate attention to prevent revenue loss.

## Insights  
- Direct acquisition remains strong, but thereâ€™s potential to grow paid channels (adwords, banner).  
- Several enterprise clients have gone completely inactive (PepsiCo, Apple, VF).  
- Sales performance is uneven â€“ some sales reps are losing multiple major accounts simultaneously.  

---

## Recommendations  
- **Re-engage top churned accounts** (PepsiCo, Apple, VF, WellCare Health Plans) with targeted outreach campaigns.  
- **Deep-dive root cause analysis** for why enterprise accounts are dropping to zero.  
- **Support sales reps** with account health dashboards and churn early-warning alerts.  
- **Strengthen marketing mix** by optimizing ad spend on channels with highest acquisition potential.  
- **Regularly monitor churn** with a live dashboard to track recovery and spot early risk signals.  
- **Cross-functional collaboration** between Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success to address systemic issues.

## Tech & Tools  
- **SQL:** for data extraction and churn logic (using CTEs and aggregations)  
- **Excel & Powerpoint:** for visualization and insight storytelling  
- **Collaboration:** Group discussions and iteration on findings

## Outcome  
This analysis highlighted significant churn risk among high-value clients and provided actionable next steps to re-engage them.  
Implementing these recommendations can help prevent further revenue loss and improve retention rates.
